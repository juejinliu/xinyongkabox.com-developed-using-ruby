Finished by Yuan Gao

This project is also deployed on www.xinyongkabox.com using heroku

This project has 5 database backed models, including the Deal, Bookmark, Comment, Like and User Model.

Among these the Deal model and the User model are in a many-to-many association, connected by the Bookmark Model.

I included a little sample data in the deal.json file under /db folder, these data are extracted from website dealmoon.com using a simple python script. 

------------------------------------------

The Deal is a complete Restful database-backed resource.
