This is the test website I try to build to show a bunch of deals

I wrote a python script to snatch the deals from website dealmoon.com, then used a form to list those data I snatched. 

Running instruction:

Just clone the repo, do bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed
Then you should be able to see a list of deals

<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
